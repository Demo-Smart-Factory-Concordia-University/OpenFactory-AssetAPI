"""
Deployment platform interfaces and implementations for OpenFactory routing layer.

This module defines the abstract base class `DeploymentPlatform`, which specifies the
interface for managing deployment of group-based services and retrieving their connection URLs.

The concrete implementation `SwarmDeploymentPlatform` uses Docker Swarm to deploy services
for each group, relying on the Docker SDK client and configuration settings.

Usage:
    - Implementations of `DeploymentPlatform` are responsible for handling
      service lifecycle events, such as creation, updating, and removal.
    - The routing layer uses these implementations to manage service availability
      per logical group.

Note:
    Uses configuration values from the shared `settings` module for Docker network and image.
