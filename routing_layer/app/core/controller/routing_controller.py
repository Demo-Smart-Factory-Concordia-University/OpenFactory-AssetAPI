"""
Routing controller for OpenFactory's Routing Layer.

This module defines the `RoutingController`, which orchestrates the behavior of
grouping strategies and deployment platforms. It is responsible for:

- Initializing and tearing down group-specific services and Kafka streams
- Handling incoming client requests and routing them to the appropriate group service
- Managing the lifecycle of group resources dynamically based on asset metadata
