"""
Grouping strategy interfaces and implementations for OpenFactory routing layer.

This module defines the abstract base class `GroupingStrategy` that specifies the
interface for assigning assets to groups and managing derived streams per group.

The `UNSLevelGroupingStrategy` class is a concrete implementation that groups assets
based on a specified UNS (Unified Namespace) level attribute, such as workcenter or area.

Key functionalities:
    - Query group membership for individual assets.
    - Retrieve all known groups.
    - Create and remove derived ksqlDB streams filtered by group.

Security:
    - Uses `escape_ksql_literal` to safely handle string interpolation in ksqlDB queries,
      mitigating SQL injection risks.

Note:
    - Relies on configuration settings from the shared `settings` module.
    - Uses the ksqlDB client from `ksql`.
