# OpenFactory-AssetAPI ‚Äî Serving Layer for Asset Data

**OpenFactory-AssetAPI** is the primary serving layer for accessing real-time and computed data from assets deployed on the OpenFactory platform. It exposes both **state query** and **streaming endpoints**, enabling developers to retrieve asset state and telemetry data efficiently.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is primarily a development repository. It is used for prototyping, experimentation, and testing new concepts.

```

### 3. Query the API

#### Get the full state for an asset:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5555/asset_state?asset_uuid=WTVB01-001" | jq
```

#### Get a specific dataItem from an asset:

```bash
